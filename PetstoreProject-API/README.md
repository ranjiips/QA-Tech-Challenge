# Swagger Petstore API

## Objective
The Swagger Petstore API is a sample API provided by Swagger to demonstrate the capabilities of the Swagger framework and the OpenAPI Specification.

**API Endpoints:** 
The API provides a variety of endpoints for different operations, such as:
+ _/pet_: Manage pet information.
+ _/store/order_: Manage store orders.
+ _/user_: Manage user accounts.

### Key Test Cases:
1. **Pet Management:**
   * **Create Pet:** Verify that a new pet can be added to the store.
   * **Get Pet by ID:** Ensure that the correct pet details are returned for a given pet ID.
   * **Update Pet:** Check that pet details can be updated successfully.
   * **Delete Pet:** Confirm that a pet can be deleted from the store.
2. **Store Order Management:**
   * **Place Order:** Validate that an order can be placed for a pet.
   * **Get Order by ID:** Ensure that the correct order details are returned for a given order ID.
   * **Delete Order:** Verify that an order can be deleted from the store.
3. **User Management:**
   * **Create User:** Verify that a new user can be created.
   * **Get User by Username:** Ensure that the correct user details are returned for a given username.
   * **Update User:** Check that user details can be updated successfully.
   * **Delete User:** Confirm that a user can be deleted from the system.

# Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to automate the API of the petstore using Python and Request. The goal is to ensure the websiteâ€™s key functionalities, such as managing pets, store orders, and user accounts.

We are following the Page Object Model and **_Singleton pattern_** ensuring that only one instance of each page class is used throughout the tests. The test methods use the Singleton instances to perform actions and verifications

### Tools and Technologies:
+ **Request Library:** For automating the rest APIs.
+ **Python:** As the programming language for writing test scripts.
+ **Pytest:** For managing and executing test cases.
+ **ConfigParser:** For managing configuration settings.
+ **CI/CD Integration:** To enable continuous testing and integration.
+ **HTML Reports:** To capture the execution reports in HTML format.

### Pre-Requiste:
- Install python 3.12
- Install Pycharm Community edition- 
- Install Git

## Getting Started
Once you met all the pre-requiste requirements, follow the below commands

* Create a local folder as per your wish to clone the project [Ex: Project]
* Open Git Bash from the folder
* Clone the project by using the command
```bash 
https://github.com/ranjiips/QA-Tech-Challenge.git 
```
* To make sure you have the latest code, run the below git command
```bash 
git fetch
git pull origin
```
* Install the required libraries from the file "requirements.txt"
* Enable the pytest test runner by following the below steps**
  * > Select the Edit Configuration under Run menu
  * > Select + symbol -> Python Tests -> pytest option

Once all the setup completes, then start execute the test cases by following the below execution commands

**Pytest Execution commands:**
- **Pet test cases:** 
```bash 
python -m pytest tests/pet_test.py -v -s --html=reports/petReport.html
```
- **Pet Store Test cases**
```bash 
python -m pytest tests/petStore_test.py -v -s --html=reports/petStoreReport.html
```
- **User Test cases**
```bash 
python -m pytest tests/user_test.py -v -s --html=reports/userReport.html
```


***Command Explanation***

When you run this command, **_pytest_** will:

+ Execute the tests in **_tests/pet_test.py_**.
+ Provide detailed output due to the **_-v_** option.
+ Show print statements and other outputs in the console because of the **_-s_** option.
+ Generate an HTML report of the test results and save it to **_reports/petReport.html_**.

**To run the test parallely, use the below command** 
```bash 
python -m pytest tests/pet_test.py -v -s -n 3 --html=reports/petReport.html
```
* **_-n 3_** Run the tests in parallel using 3 worker processes, which can speed up the execution.

**To run the specific marker/tag:**
```bash 
python -m pytest -m pet
```
